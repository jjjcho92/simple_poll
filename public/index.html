        In regards of recent climate and news, Iâ€™d like to make clear before the project that anti-Semitism has no
        place in our society, <br></br> and we as a global community strongly condemn and have no tolerance for the promotion of
        any form of hate speech.<br></br> I believe in these situations, as a diverse learning community, our first action must
        be open, honest dialogue.
